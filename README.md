  ## Description
  I've decided to discontinue this project, as I've learned that this type of code is in violation of the [LinkedIn User Agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/56347/prohibited-software-and-extensions?lang=en).  However, I thought the code may still be of use as an example to the community.  Use this code at your own risk. 

  This is a crawler for getting information of your secondary connections on LinkedIn.  When you have defined te company, and entered in your username and password in the app.js, you will get an Object consisting of all of your secondary connections in that company and your best connection.  

  ## Requirements 
  You will need both a LinkedIn account and a Sales Navigator account for this program to work. 

  ## Installation Instructions
  Do a git pull to a folder to start using.  Note that you will need to do a npm install as well.  Note also that you need to enter into the app.js the company that you are searching for, and your username and password before starting the program. 

  ## Usage Information
  Type node app.js to start the program.  You will need to enter in your text code to log into your account.  Then the automation will start.
